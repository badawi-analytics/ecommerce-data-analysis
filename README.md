E-commerce Data Analysis Project
Project Overview
This project analyzes an e-commerce dataset to understand customer behavior, order trends, and operational performance. The goal is to extract actionable insights using Python and provide a clear view of the business operations.
Dataset
The project uses multiple tables:
Customers: Information about each customer (ID, location).
Orders: Order details including status, timestamps, and customer IDs.
Order Items: Details of items per order, including product, seller, price, and freight value.
Payments: Payment types, values, and installments per order.
Products: Product specifications and categories.
Sellers: Seller location and IDs.
Geolocation: Latitude, longitude, and location data for ZIP codes.
Tools & Libraries
Python: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
Jupyter Notebook: Step-by-step analysis
Key Insights
Order Status Analysis: Most orders were delivered; canceled and processing orders were minimal.
Top Customers: Identified the customers with the highest spending.
Seller Performance: Calculated average delivery delays and highlighted sellers with consistent delays.
Shipping Analysis: Examined correlation between total order weight and delivery delays to identify operational bottlenecks.
Operational Recommendations: Highlighted areas for improving shipping efficiency and customer satisfaction.
Conclusion
This project demonstrates the ability to clean, merge, and analyze multiple e-commerce datasets in Python. It provides actionable insights for improving operations, customer management, and seller performance.
